Hi, this is raju.

I am learning ubuntu and linux basic commands.

As far as I know Linux has a kernel which is considered as a heart of the Linux operating system.
It talks to operating system, applications etc.

Some of the basic commands I have learned so far are:



apt					 : apt stands for advance packaging tool, it can be used with different commands like apt update, apt install etc .
					   it is necessary to update before installing any packages. i.e apt update and then apt install
 
apt list				 : apt list shows what packages are installed on our ubuntu/linux system

pwd			                 : present working directory

ls			                 : list all files/folders in current working directory

cd dirname		                 : change directory to a particular directory 

cd ..			                 : to go to previous directory

touch			                 : touch command is used to create files

mkdir			                 : make directory

mv ../fname .		                 : to move a file from previous folder to current working directory

rm _filename_		                 : to remove a file with name 

cd~ or cd		                 : to goto home directory

sudo			                 : to run any command as administrator

sudo apt-get update		         : to install any updates on ubuntu or linux

man				         : man means manual, use with commands to learn more

apt-get install pckg                     : to install any softwares on ubuntu/linux pckg represents package name

cp source dest                           : copy file from source to destination

sudo scp i keyPname source destination   : scp command is used to copy any file from server to local or local to server but it will only be used in local server
e.g sudo scp -i mykeypair.pem downloads/raju.png ubuntu@ec2-54-72-184-240.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/my_folder



touch file-{1..10}.txt                   : to create multiple files

rm file-{1..10}.txt                      : to remove multiple files

rm textfiles*				 : to remove all files with string textfiles. i.e this will remove all files with textfiles as names in current directory 

free					 : free command is used to check how 
					   how much memory is used (Ram)

top					 : top command is used to check which processes are running in our RAM. 


df -H					 :  df -H is used to check how much disk is free and how much is utilized

awk					 : awk is a scripting language used to manipulate files or outputs, used for segmenting outputs i.e we can display columns

df -H | awk '{print $1}'		 : the output of df -H will be input to awk using pipe(|) and awk will print the first column 


crontab					 : a file where we see what is being scheduled

crontab -l				 : to list all the cron jobs in our system

rm -r directory name                     : to remove directory recursively and all its content

ls -1                                    : to list files/folder by single line

mv dir_name new_dir                      : to rename a directory

mv file_name new_file                    : to rename a file

mv file_name /home/raju/new_file         : to move file to new directory with a new name

cat filename				 : to display the content of small file

less filename				 : to list the contents of long file in an interactive way

head -5 filename			 : to display the first five lines of a file

tail -5 filename			 : to display the last five lines of a file

script filename                          : to recored every command you type and its output and save it in a file. very handy if you keep forgetting commands you runned in your linux.

join file1 file2                         : join two files depending upon the similarity between them

split filename taggingname               : split larger files into smaller files. default size for smaller size file is 1000 lines. used with flags -n to specify how many small files you want to create of large file


diff  file1 file2                        : used to show the difference between two files. used with flags -d to show which lines needed to deleted to make the identical, -c the changes to be made in file1 and file2 to make them identical

comm file1 file2                         : used to compare two sorted files. The first column in output shows element only in file1 , second column shows the only element in file2, third line shows common elements.

cmp file1 file2                          : used to compare files. outputs the line number in which there is difference between two files.

wc filename                              : used to count the words in a file along with spaces. use with flags. i.e -l lines , -w words , -L longest , -m character counts

paste file1 file2                         : used to join two files together. it displays in column form. useful to see difference as well

grep -n apple file1 file2                : used to search out a field in a file or files. -c count of occurences , -l display list of files which contains keyword/pattern/word, -n display line number along lines containing a pattern

aspell check filename                    : to check a spelling mistake in a word in a file.

Shortcuts:

ctrl+shift+v                            : to paste

ctrl+c                                  : to copy

ctrl+l                                  : to clear screen

Udemy Linux Commands:


Basic Commands:

1-  date            :    to print current date
2-  ncal            :	prints the calendar
3-  cal		    :    prints the calendar 
4-  clear	    :    clears the screen
5-  sort	    :    takes a file as an arguments and sort the contents inside alphabetically syntax: sort hello.txt
6-  type	    :    type commans will tell us the type of a command. syntax : type echo , type mkdir 
7-  which	    :    tells where a command is located. i.e in simple words file name where a command is defined. Syntax: which echo
8-  man		    :    man command to print the manual about any command. syntax: man ls , man mkdir etc. man contains manual for 8 different command type. i.e system type, user type and for file types. i.e man -k ls. Furthermore to read a manual for a command we can use space key to go page by page forward. B for backward
9-  help            :    help command used to print out help regarding anything if there is no manual for it.
10- who             :    who command is used to see user and system info. i.e who is logged in, when did the last system boot etc. used with options
11- login           :    used to login as a different user
12- passwd          :    used to set a password for the current user you are logged in as





Arrow Keys:
1- left and right arrow keys are using to move the cursor
2- Up arrow cycles through the previous commands I used
3- Down arrow to use the latest commands

Up and Down keys are not actually that much useful for short cuts but for long commands it can come in handy.


Arguments or Parameters in Linux:

we can use arguments with commands as most commands use arguments.i.e 
echo hello   : here hello is an argument to echo command
ncal 2021    : here 2021 is an arument to ncal command. It will print whole 20201 calendar.

Its not necessary that it will always accept one argument. some commands require more arguments.

The basic structure of a commands is:

command options arguments

The order of arguments also matters in some commands but not necessarily in all of them.


options change the behaviour of commands. i.e
ncal -j		 : will print current month with days in 1,2,3 format. i.e it will print the day according to 365 days and will highlight which day of the year it is.
ncal -h		 : will print the current month without highlighting the current day.
ncal 2022 -j	 : will print the whole year in 365 days format and highlights the current date


We can combine multiple options: like
ncal -3hMj       : will print the the previous current next month with monday as first day and with no highlighting


====================================================================

Types of Commands:
There are basically four type of commands:
- An executable program usually stored in /bin  /usr/bin or usr/local/bin. These are compile binary files hence bin
- A built in shell command. Commands part of shell
- A shell function
- An alias  is custom user command

We can find the types of commands using type and then followed by command


=====================================================================

Process Related Commands:
 - ps             : command to display the characteristics of processes

   Usage:
     ps -f        : will show a full listing of all the processes
     ps -u user   : will show a listing of processes run by user
     ps -a        : processes of all users
     ps -e        : processess including user and system

   ps -fu raju    : will list all processing run by raju in full listing mode
