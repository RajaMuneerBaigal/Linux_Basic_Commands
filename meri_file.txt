Hi, this is raju.

I am learning ubuntu and linux basic commands.

As far as I know Linux has a kernel which is considered as a heart of the Linux operating system.
It talks to operating system, applications etc.

Some of the basic commands I have learned so far are:



apt					 : apt stands for advance packaging tool, it can be used with different commands like apt update, apt install etc .
					   it is necessary to update before installing any packages. i.e apt update and then apt install

apt list				 : apt list shows what packages are installed on our ubuntu/linux system

pwd			                 : present working directory

ls			                 : list all files/folders in current working directory

cd dirname		                 : change directory to a particular directory 

cd ..			                 : to go to previous directory

touch			                 : touch command is used to create files

mkdir			                 : make directory

mv ../fname .		                 : to move a file from previous folder to current working directory

rm _filename_		                 : to remove a file with name 

cd~ or cd		                 : to goto home directory

sudo			                 : to run any command as administrator

sudo apt-get update		         : to install any updates on ubuntu or linux

man				         : man means manual, use with commands to learn more

apt-get install pckg                     : to install any softwares on ubuntu/linux pckg represents package name

cp source dest                           : copy file from source to destination

sudo scp i keyPname source destination   : scp command is used to copy any file from server to local or local to server but it will only be used in local server
e.g sudo scp -i mykeypair.pem downloads/raju.png ubuntu@ec2-54-72-184-240.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/my_folder



touch file-{1..10}.txt                   : to create multiple files

rm file-{1..10}.txt                      : to remove multiple files


free					 : free command is used to check how 
					   how much memory is used (Ram)

top					 : top command is used to check which processes are running in our RAM. 


df -H					 :  df -H is used to check how much disk is free and how much is utilized

awk					 : awk is a scripting language used to manipulate files or outputs, used for segmenting outputs i.e we can display columns

df -H | awk '{print $1}'		 : the output of df -H will be input to awk using pipe(|) and awk will print the first column 


crontab					 : a file where we see what is being scheduled

crontab -l				 : to list all the cron jobs in our system

crontab -e				 : to edit a crontab file
