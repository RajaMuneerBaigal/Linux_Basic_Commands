Hi, this is raju.

I am learning ubuntu and linux basic commands.

As far as I know Linux has a kernel which is considered as a heart of the Linux operating system.
It talks to operating system, applications etc.

Some of the basic commands I have learned so far are:



apt					 : apt stands for advance packaging tool, it can be used with different commands like apt update, apt install etc .
					   it is necessary to update before installing any packages. i.e apt update and then apt install

apt list				 : apt list shows what packages are installed on our ubuntu/linux system

pwd			                 : present working directory

ls			                 : list all files/folders in current working directory

cd dirname		                 : change directory to a particular directory 

cd ..			                 : to go to previous directory

touch			                 : touch command is used to create files

mkdir			                 : make directory

mv ../fname .		                 : to move a file from previous folder to current working directory

rm _filename_		                 : to remove a file with name 

cd~ or cd		                 : to goto home directory

sudo			                 : to run any command as administrator

sudo apt-get update		         : to install any updates on ubuntu or linux

man				         : man means manual, use with commands to learn more

apt-get install pckg                     : to install any softwares on ubuntu/linux pckg represents package name

cp source dest                           : copy file from source to destination

sudo scp i keyPname source destination   : scp command is used to copy any file from server to local or local to server but it will only be used in local server
e.g sudo scp -i mykeypair.pem downloads/raju.png ubuntu@ec2-54-72-184-240.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/my_folder



touch file-{1..10}.txt                   : to create multiple files

rm file-{1..10}.txt                      : to remove multiple files

rm textfiles*				 : to remove all files with string textfiles. i.e this will remove all files with textfiles as names in current directory 

free					 : free command is used to check how 
					   how much memory is used (Ram)

top					 : top command is used to check which processes are running in our RAM. 


df -H					 :  df -H is used to check how much disk is free and how much is utilized

awk					 : awk is a scripting language used to manipulate files or outputs, used for segmenting outputs i.e we can display columns

df -H | awk '{print $1}'		 : the output of df -H will be input to awk using pipe(|) and awk will print the first column 


crontab					 : a file where we see what is being scheduled

crontab -l				 : to list all the cron jobs in our system

crontab -e				 : to edit a crontab file


rm -r directory name                     : to remove directory recursively and all its content

ls -1                                    : to list files/folder by single line

mv dir_name new_dir                      : to rename a directory

mv file_name new_file                    : to rename a file

mv file_name /home/raju/new_file         : to move file to new directory with a new name

cat filename				 : to display the content of small file

less filename				 : to list the contents of long file in an interactive way

head -5 filename			 : to display the first five lines of a file

Shortcuts:
